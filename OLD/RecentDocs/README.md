# Invoke-UserActivityParser
Invoke-UserActivityParser is my attempt to parse information out of the registry regarding user activity.
This includes numerous registry keys.

I've performed only limited testing with Windows 8.1 and PowerShell version 4 at this time.

# Usage
.\Invoke-UserActivityParser.ps1

# Thanks
Below are a list of sources I used when writing this script.
